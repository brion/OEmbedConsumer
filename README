http://oembed.com/ for protocol docs


Example to use:
<oembed>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sau6l9TOhgk</oembed>

This currently works only with sites that offer discoverable oEmbed JSON data.

It also has no security -- provider sites may produce arbitrary HTML which will be
included, which is NOT acceptable to run on any real site anywhere.



Todo:
* sane error handling
* facility to use a restricted iframe (security!)
* cache data
* size hints
* redo as parser function, accept parameters in style of [[Image:]]
* toolbar insert helper
* whitelist known providers?
* backup providers such as embed.ly?
* asynchronous fetch or such?
